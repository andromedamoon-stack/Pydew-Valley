# Pydew-Valley

A Stardew Valley clone based off of Clear Code's tutorial for FreeCodeCamp.

##What I hope to learn from this project:

Pygame
How to incorporate Tiled and other outside frameworks with Python


##Later Goals:

Make new features on my own
Make my own story, setting, characters
Turn into a slightly larger game, maybe add in some RPG elements


## tools
Python
Pygame
Tiled
